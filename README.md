A

## Note for This Class
1. This was probably one of the hardest classes I took in graduate school. Each assignment in this class is a lot of work, but you can usually learn a lot from each assignment, like the logic behind each model/classifier. I usually spend 30-45 hours per assignment, so it's best to take this class when you're not busy. Overall, this class is great if you are interested in machine learning.
2. This class requires you to have some calculus/linear algebra background. For me, I forgot a lot of my undergraduate calculus knowledge, so when I learned some calculus-related content, I felt a little difficult (for example, when I was learning backpropagation, I watched the lecture video 5 times but still couldn't understand how it works)
3. Because the contents of the exam folder may offend the professor's class, I deleted the contents of the exam folder

## Note

3. Please **DO NOT** email me with questions about my/your assignemnts, you should finish your work by yourself. I won't reply to those emails. (The only reason you're emailing me should be that some of my content violates your course content).
4. Some parts of the assignment may be wrong because I don't remember each assignment grades, so I put my grades for this course for your reference. Again please just have it for inspiration and **DO NOT** use it for plagiarism.
5. The predecessors planted trees, and the later generations enjoyed the shade. I also got a lot of inspiration from other people's repo in the process of learning, so I uploaded my course material, I hope these content will help you.
